        <p>Have you ever played with legos?If you have not you should try it.I personnaly like legos because they are1.fun,2.there not that stresful,and 3. you can play some games with them.Like The Competition.The rules are simple each player has a few legos and there is a time limil lets say for about 2minutes.when someone says start the players should dump there lego bag.And start building then when the times up they show it to the parents aka judges and who has the best creation wins.So that is why personaly i like Legos</p>
